## Plankton classification with convolutional neural networks

This repository contains code for my bachelor's thesis.

The final trained neural networks are omitted for DenseNet-feat, VGG16-feat and VGG19-feat because of their large size. Trained MyLeNet and MyCNN models are however included.
These and information about every model's training progress are found in ```models/```.
